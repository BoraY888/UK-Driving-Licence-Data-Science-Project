# UK-Driving-Licence-Data-Science-Project
Creation of an interactive dashboard on Streamlit to analyse UK Driving Licence data

## UK Drivers Age Visualisation
**Plan**

For the first visualisation in the dashboard I want to create simple bar charts that display the age of drivers, and how many of the types of licences each age groups holds, as well as how many penalty points each age 
group has accumulated. 

**Design**

A sketch was created using Draw.io and uploaded to the repository as an XML file. Two bar charts will be created with age groups starting with 16-17, then 18-20 and 3 year intervals till 27-29, and 5 year intervals 
after. The interactive elements will include changing which types of driving licences the user wants to see, and which number of penalty points the user would like to see on the bar chart. Also, appropriate colours 
must be chosen to account for colourblind users.
